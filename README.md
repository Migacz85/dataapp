# Shill Bid Dataset Analysis üéâ

This web app allows users to interactively explore and analyze the Shill Bid dataset. The main goal of this app is to detect Shill bids using various filtering and machine learning techniques. The app provides detailed charts and visualizations to effectively communicate insights and patterns within the data. Users can also experiment with different feature values and classifiers to improve the detection of Shill bids.

## Features

- **Introduction**: A brief overview of the Shill Bid dataset and the goals of the web app.
- **Dataset**: Displays the dataset and basic statistics to help users understand the data.
- **Histograms**: Interactive histograms for visualizing the distribution of each feature.
- **Histogram Analyser**: Allows users to explore and compare histograms for different features.
- **Clusters**: Visualizations of 2D and 3D clusters to identify Shill bids patterns.
- **Filtering Shill Bids**: An interactive feature to filter and display Shill bids based on feature values.
- **Detecting Shill Bids**: A machine learning based approach to detecting Shill bids using Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM classifiers.
